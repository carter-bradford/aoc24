# Day 5 Approach

* Read in all the rules
* Use the rules to create a master list of page ordering
* For each update, associated each page with its ordering index and sort by this
* Pluck the middlev value
* Sum / Fold the results


To make this easier, I'm going to change the approach.   Instead of trying to organize the rules, I'm just going to brute force check each update.
